ready for v3 ?

..we are... here's what we're lookin' forward too...

* speed - especially on redesigns, and in some cases like color, instant changes..
* lock down - locking down certain sections of a site when we feel they look good..
* typography - new fonts, not too sure how it will work yet, but we'll see..
* the app - improvements with the app.. the website now is the app..
