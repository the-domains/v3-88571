> "I'll never forget the first time the prototype for v3 came together and we saw end to end that instant real-time redesign ..it was months and months of just too many all-nighters and retweeking a lot of the core algorithms to get from a few seconds to 100 milliseconds to sub 10 milliseconds and yeah we're just ..we're tired this is literally sunrise after another all-nighter and there's three other engineers there and finally all comes together and there's just this moment were just everything connects and then we stopped and we clicked around and it was just it was amazing everything ..it was so beautiful that there was literally a tear in every persons eyes and we just stopped and like just couldn't help but bask in this like amazing feeling of wow it really has been worth it.. this is the game-changing difference that we need ..and yeah so there's been a reason why I've been we've been somewhat quiet because this is ..this is been consuming just our whole mind everything we do and and V3's is it's a big deal and it's an exciting time for us because we can finally share it with you.." ~D4
